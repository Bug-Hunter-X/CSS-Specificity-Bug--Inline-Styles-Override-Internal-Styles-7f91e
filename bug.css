The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully considered.  For example, if you have an inline style that conflicts with an internal style sheet rule, the inline style will override, even if the internal style sheet rule has higher specificity according to the cascade. This can be hard to debug because the browser's developer tools may not clearly indicate the source of the conflicting style.
